Armchair astronomers, casual observers, and archaeo-astronomers will rejoice
with the use of Planet Finder. No longer is it necessary to carry
around printouts of an ephemeris. Now you can explore the heavens,
compare ancient observations, or just find out when the Sun goes down,
right in the palm of your hand. No need to perform lengthy calculations
by your hand calculator - Planet Finder does it all for you.

<p>Planet Finder's calendar does not rely on the Operating System date
system so you can browse any date in history. A word of caution though,
the position algorithm (like any) gets increasingly inaccurate as the date
gets very far from the present. Observations in Ptolemy's Almagest
dating 150 AD have come very close to what Planet Finder will give you. It is fair to say that the algorithms are usable for 3000 years from the
present. The current algorithm is accurate to one arcminute within
300 years of the present, outside of that maybe as much as a degree? Of course Pluto is about 15 times more inaccurate since we have only been
watching it for about a quarter of its orbit.

<p>Planet Finder is an astronomical calculator for the Newton 2.x operating
system. It has been tested on an MP2100, please let Prism Research
know if it operates on any other machine including NOS 1.x. The application
is divided into two parts, the engine (<b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">AstroLib</b>) and the interface (Planet
Finder). <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">AstroLib</b> is a powerful prototype of astronomy routines that
can be imported into any application. Planet Finder will not operate
unless <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">AstroLib</b> is loaded onto the Newton first.

<p>Planet Finder is released as Honorware, i.e. if you have honor, you
will pay Prism Research US$10 for the two years of research it took to
put this little application together. An update will be continually
released here as long as people have honor. There are no passwords
or obnoxious windows popping up.

<p>In the future, Prism Research intends to write other astronomy and astrology
applications which utilize the existing <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">AstroLib</b> library of routines.
