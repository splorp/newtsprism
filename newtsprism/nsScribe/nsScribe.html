nsScribe is an extension to the Newton 2.x Operating System. nsScribe will
insert the answer to any NewtonScript question, similar to the Inspector
in NTK, into your note or document by the tap of the Assist button or a
Newton Works tool. Write some text in any program, highlight it, tap the
button, and the answer will be inserted right after the question. When
used with Newton Works paper, it can compile unlimited amounts of NewtonScript,
its only limitations are proper NewtonScript and Newton memory. The Intelligent
Assistant from Newton provides a further limitation to 15 "words" which
are separated by spaces if the Assist button is used. The answer will be
decompiled into proper NewtonScript 2.x (unless it's too big) which can
then be reused by NTK. Output size is user controllable by printDepth and
printLength global variables.

<P>Teachers:
<BR>Write homework pages in Newton Works or the notepad and beam the page
to your students. You can check their answers right on the page when they
beam you back the answers. Or have them check their work themselves. The
homework assignments can consist of algebra, trigonometry, programming,
business math, and with <A HREF="../MathLib/MathLib.html">MathLib </A>can
include calculus, statistics, engineering, physics, acoustics, vectors,
matrix algebra, fraction algebra.
