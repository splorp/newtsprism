BinHex arrives for the Newton! Finally we can encode and decode standard
BinHex files. Don't get your hopes up, it does not support compression
like .zip or .sit. What this product will give you is the ability
to get ANY binary off and on the Newton safely. A picture or a sound
or a streamed object can be BinHex'd and transferred to the desktop or
Internet safely. BinHexer works flawlessly with Tibet photos, Notepad
sounds, ViewFrame, NewtonWorks. Actually, Newton Works is required
as a go-between for the new BinHex'd document. What appears on the
desktop is industry standard files such as AIFF-C sound files, AU sound
files, PICT image files, PICT resources, ICON resources, NTK stream files.

<p>As an example of how powerful a binary transfer utility this is, here
are all of the <a href="/newtsprism/BinHexer/streams.hqx">Magic
Pointers</a> in NOS 2.1 turned into Stream files that can be used by NTK. Also courtesy of BinHexer, here are 200+ <a href="/newtsprism/BinHexer/pictures.hqx">pictures</a>
and icons that occur on the 2.1 ROM. And some <a href="/newtsprism/BinHexer/sounds.hqx">sounds</a>. And some pictures as Mac <a href="/newtsprism/BinHexer/resources.hqx">resources</a>. BinHexer can transfer an entire song onto your Newton like an MP3 player. MP3 songs must be converted to AIFF or mu-Law or GSM first.

<p>Download a 14 day trial copy <a href="/newtsprism/BinHexer/BinHexer.hqx">here</a>(45
kB .sit.hqx file)
