BinHex arrives for the Newton!&nbsp; Finally we can encode and decode standard
BinHex files.&nbsp; Don't get your hopes up, it does not support compression
like .zip or .sit.&nbsp; What this product will give you is the ability
to get ANY binary off and on the Newton safely.&nbsp; A picture or a sound
or a streamed object can be BinHex'd and transferred to the desktop or
Internet safely.&nbsp; BinHexer works flawlessly with Tibet photos, Notepad
sounds, ViewFrame, NewtonWorks.&nbsp; Actually, Newton Works is required
as a go-between for the new BinHex'd document.&nbsp; What appears on the
desktop is industry standard files such as AIFF-C sound files, AU sound
files, PICT image files, PICT resources, ICON resources, NTK stream files.

<p>As an example of how powerful a binary transfer utility this is, here
are all of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060430190945/http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/newtsprism/BinHexer/streams.hqx">Magic
Pointers</a> in NOS 2.1 turned into Stream files that can be used by NTK.&nbsp;
Also coutesy of BinHexer, here are 200+ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060430190945/http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/newtsprism/BinHexer/pictures.hqx">pictures</a>
and icons that occur on the 2.1 ROM.&nbsp; And some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060430190945/http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/newtsprism/BinHexer/sounds.hqx">sounds</a>.&nbsp;
