<h1>About Prism Research</h1>

<p>Prism Research was founded by Jonathan Kipling Knight in June of 1997 in order to provide meaningful research tools to the Newton community. Prism Research was launched from the former Bordini and Associates which was a DBA used to start research. It's first product was MathLib, the only advanced math library of object-oriented routines available for the Newton. With the fall of the Newton from the market, Prism Research has placed in "support" mode and has not pursued active Newton development since 2003. Current focus is looking towards the iPhone platform.</p>
