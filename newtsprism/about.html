<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>About Prism Research</FONT></CENTER>


<P>Prism Research was founded by Jonathan Kipling Knight in June of 1997
in order to provide meaningful research tools to the Newton community.
Prism Research was launched from the former Bordini and Associates which
was a DBA used to start research. It's first product was MathLib, the only
advanced math library of object-oriented routines available for the Newton.
With the fall of the Newton from the market, Prism Research has placed in
"support" mode and has not pursued active Newton development since 2003.
Current focus is looking towards the iPhone platform.

<P>About the founder:

<P>Jonathan Kipling Knight has a BS in Physics, an MA in Applied Mathematics
and a PhD in Computer Science. He has been researching the
Newton environment since 1995. Kip has been programming since 1984 and
says he has "finally found a worthy operating system." He has authored
various Tech Notes on the NS BASIC web site. He has authored two papers on
improving the speed of calculating rotation points from motion capture data.
